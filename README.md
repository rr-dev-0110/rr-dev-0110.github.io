# Student Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase the skills and experiences of a Computer Engineering student aspiring to become a web developer. The portfolio includes sections for personal information, skills, projects, and experiences, providing a comprehensive view of the student's capabilities.

- **css/style.css**: The stylesheet that defines the layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design elements to ensure the portfolio is visually appealing on various devices.
  
- **images/profile.jpg**: A personal image of the student, used to add a personal touch to the portfolio.
